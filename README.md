# Fridgit

Fridgit is a smart refrigerator that keeps a user’s food inventory for them. It acts as a traditional fridge, but also houses an internal computer that can tell a user how long an item has been in it and if there are any items that the user should use soon. To make the process of adding items easy, the Fridgit’s computer can track the movement of items in and out of it by using two internal cameras. An external display allows manual alteration of the food database.
